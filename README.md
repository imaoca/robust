# Background

In general, cyber security tends to focus on protecting information devices and data from malicious attackers.  
In addition to this, securing communication from accidents and natural disasters is also an important task of cyber security.  
We have designed a contest to compete for skills to accomplish such tasks.  

# What is Robust Protocol Open Challenge

Node A and Node B are connected by a faulty LAN cable.  
Transfer files from node A to B or node B to A.  
Compete for the number of error-free file transfers.

# What is a LAN cable with a failure

The Jamming Machine is used to cause a pseudo failure in LAN cable(10BASE-T).  
This Jamming Machine is located between the LAN cables and interferes with communication by injecting electrical noise into the cables.  
The noise pattern and timing are programmable, and this time it is adjusted to about 50% packet loss with Ping examine.  

# Robust Protocol Open Challenge trial site

We have prepared a remote server that causes a pseudo failure on LAN.   
Nodes are constructed by two Raspberry Pi-2.  
You can participate in the contest by logging in with SSH, etc.  
The following languages can be used to implement the protocol.  

- gcc version 8.3.0(Raspbian 8.3.0-6+rpi1)  
- go version go1.15.3 linux/arm  
- Python 2.7.16  
- Python 3.7.3  
- Rust  
- NodeJS v14.15.4 (npm v6.14.10)

**Hanako's eth1 IP address can change.  
Now it's 192.168.3.8.**

# Scoring method

After the time limit, we will check the files that have been saved inside the receiving side. Scoring will be done as follows.  
  
- \+ 10pts per correct file  
- \- 10pts per file containing errors  
- \- 5pts per duplicate file (files with equal content)

# Trial site SSH accounts

The trial site is currently available.  
If you want to try it, please send us your SSH public key and group number.   
After creating an account, we will send you your login information. Please DM me via Slack.  
  
@Naoki Takayama [JP.22tw.Sf]
 
Currently, trial site login rights are only granted to "GCC 2022 Taiwan" participants.

# Trial Site Schedule Management

Each group can test the developed program on the trial site. 
However, if multiple programs use the failed LAN simultaneously, the performance will be affected, which could cause it to differ from the actual performance.
If you want to use the trial site, you need to make a reservation, so please check it out.
